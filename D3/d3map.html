			This interactive map shows the percentage of a population that lives in the biggest city of that country. The data is defined in five categories of which the highest category is defined by a percentage above 90%. In that way, city-states really pop out. The other values are divided in four categories.

			When hovering over a country, the contours and colours of that county change to make it visually pop out. By broadening the strokewidth of the contours and colouring the stroke with a more saturized colour than the country's fill, a country seems to visually come forward towards the reader a bit. The orange color contrasts with the green map to make the difference between a highlighted country and the rest very clear. Further the precise data about a country is shown when hovering over it in a tooltip.

			My map shows to the reader immediately which countries population is highly centralized in one city and which countries have a more geographically divided population. It doesn't show which city is the biggest city of a country and my map also doesn't tell the reader about the overall urbanization level of a country. That might be information that interests a reader that is interested in this map.
